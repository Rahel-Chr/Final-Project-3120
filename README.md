Project Purpose and Functionality:
This project is a Python-based tool that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and visualize weather forecast data for a given location. It Retrieves weather data based on user-provided latitude and longitude.
Processes and organizes the data into a readable format.
Generates data visualizations, including:
Line charts showing temperature trends over time.
Correlation heatmaps displaying relationships between temperature metrics.
Bar charts representing mean temperature variations over time.
The tool is modular, with a parent class handling API interactions, a child class adding data processing capabilities, and a utility class dedicated to generating visualizations.



Installation Instructions:
Python 3.8 or later
pip (Python package manager)
